                The <b>
                Html Panel </b>enables you to enter and format any HTML type content such as text, 
                images and links. You can enter the content directly or copy and paste the 
                content from any other source. </p>
       <p>
                After your content is entered, you can format it in many ways using the tools in 
                the tool bar. </p>
       <p>
                You can also preview the content and go into HTML mode to customized your 
                content in pure HTML. This is only advised for experts in HTML code. In HTML mode , you can also add javascript code and CSS style code.</p>
       <p>
                If you are trying to add image and links be certain that all hyperlink begin 
                with &quot;http&quot; and have the full URL of the image or link you want. Shortcut URLs 
                will not work. Shortcut URLs are often found in a company&#39;s website. For example 
                if the website is &quot;<a href="http://mydomain.com">http://mydomain.com</a>&quot; and 
                there is an image in the top folder named &quot;myimage.png&quot; , many websites will 
                refer to it as &quot;./myimage.png&quot; which assumes the base URL of the website. This 
                shortcut will not work here. However you can get the image to be displayed if 
                you use the entire URL. In this example it would be &quot;<a 
                    href="http://mydomain.com/myimage.png">http://mydomain.com/myimage.png</a>&quot;.</p>
