                The <b>
                Compute </b>property<b>
                </b>is used to compute values and run commands on the device like formulas in Excel. The 
                operations that are currently available are:</p>
       <p style="font-weight: 700">
                <strong>=</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style1">This assigns the value of one field 
                or a constant to the value of another field. The field name is its internal name 
                in its property sheet. For example, suppose a text field has the internal name 
                &quot;amount&quot; and a picker sub-field has the name &quot;cost&quot;. Then 
                &quot;amount = cost&quot; assigns the value of the selected picker &quot;cost&quot; to the 
                &quot;amount&quot; field.&nbsp; In another example, &quot;amount = 100&quot; assigns the value &quot;100&quot; 
                to the amount field.</span></p>
       <p>
                <strong>+, - , * ,&nbsp; /&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; These are arithmetic operations on field values. For 
                example &quot;field1 = field2 + 10&quot; or field1 = field2 * field3&quot;. 
                Currently, the use of &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; are not supported. To 
                check out a good example of using the Compute property, see the template app 
                TapNCharge.</p>
       <p>
                <strong>Now()</strong>&nbsp; This will get the current date time and time zone 
                in hours relative to Greenwich mean time. For example &quot;field1 = Now()&quot; After the 
                computation, the value of field1 is &quot;2011-03-26 13:49:23 -0400&quot;</p>
       <p>
                <strong>PlayAudio()</strong> This will play the audio in a field. For example 
                &quot;PlayAudio(field1)&quot; where field1 is an audio field or hidden field containing an 
                audio URL. This example will play the&nbsp; audio of the URL in field1.</p>
       <p>
       <span class="body" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">
                <strong>ShowWebPage()</strong> This will show the web page for a URL value of a 
                field. For example 
                &quot;ShowWebPage(url_field)&quot; where url_field is a field or hidden field containing a URL. 
        </span></p>
       <p>
                The state of a <strong>switch</strong> or <strong>checkbox</strong> can be set 
                by assigning the <strong>switch</strong> or <strong>checkbox</strong> to either
                <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. For example &quot;switch1 = 
                true&quot; will set the field switch1 to &quot;on&quot; if the switch type for switch1 is
                <strong>on-off</strong> or set switch1 to &quot;checked&quot; if the switch type is
                <strong>checkbox.</strong></p>
       <p>
                A sequence of statements can be used in one compute field separated by a &quot;;&quot;. 
                For example, &quot;field1 = field2; field3 = 100; switch1=false&quot;.</p>
