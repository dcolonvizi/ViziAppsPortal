                The <b>
                Hidden Field </b>is used as a temporary storage of either a value or an array of 
                values. The field is invisible on the device. 
                Like any other input or output field, the value of this field can be used in a 
                compute statement or as an input or output of a web service or a database field 
                value. </p>
       <p>
                Typically, a <strong>Hidden Field</strong> is used to store something in a delayed action 
                or store a hidden value. For 
                example, the output of a web service in one action may be a value that may be 
                assigned to a text field after a button is tapped. In such an example, the value 
                may be a percent that is used to compute the percent of an amount field after 
                the &quot;percent&quot; button is pressed. So in the first step, the percent value is 
                retrieved from a web service and stored in a hidden field. Then in the compute 
                statement of the &quot;percent&quot; button, the hidden field is referrred in a compute 
                statement like &quot;tip = hidden_percent * amount / 100&quot; where the names in the 
                compute statement are names of fields.</p>
