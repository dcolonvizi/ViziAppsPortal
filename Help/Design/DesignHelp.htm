                The <b>Visual Design </b>page allows you to drop fields into pages of 
                your apps and drag and scale them into the position you want.<br />
                <br />
                To start, 
                create a new app by clicking on the new app icon and then add fields by clicking on any of the field tool buttons 
                to the left of the 
                device canvas. This will display the field properties and enable you to insert 
                the field on the canvas. Add as many fields and pages as you want to design your app.</p>
