            <h1><a name="kanchor23"></a>Best Practices for Using Spreadsheets</h1>
            <p>As you create apps, you'll probably derive some of your own best practices. Here are some generic ones that apply to almost any app.</p>
            <h2>Planning and Design</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="1">Don't put sensitive data like credit card numbers in a Google Docs spreadsheet. If you need to work with sensitive data, use Google Docs <i>within </i>Google Apps for Business (<a href="google_apps_for_business.htm" class="MCXref xref">See "Google Apps for Business"</a>) or use ViziApps' SQL database or web service options.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="2">Consider the client as you set up your spreadsheet and worksheets in order to:</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel2" value="3">Limit the overall maintenance and updating work that the client has to do.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel2" value="4">Limit the maintenance and updating work to as few worksheets as possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ContinueLevel1_Bullet">The goal is to simplify the work to be done by clients for whom app data maintenance is a small part of their work and something with which they're not very familiar or comfortable.</p>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="1">Give worksheets descriptive names like "prospects". Don't use vague names like “sheet1”.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="2">Make sure spreadsheet field names can be easily associated with device field names. For example, if users will enter a prospect's name in a field on the device in order to pass that entry to a field in the spreadsheet, name the device field something like <i>prospect_name_field </i>and the spreadsheet field something like <i>prospect_name</i>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ContinueLevel1_Bullet">Why <i>prospect_name_field</i> for the device field name rather than <i>prospect_name</i>? Every object on an app page needs an internal code name for reference. A field on the device, such as prospect name field, may actually consist of two objects, the field label and the entry field. You can't have duplicate names so you'd have to name the objects something like <i>prospect_name_label</i> and <i>prospect_name_field</i>. </p>
            <p class="ContinueLevel1_Bullet">If you find it confusing or cumbersome to refer to the <i>prospect_name_field</i> field, you could simply refer to the two objects as <i>prospect_name_label</i> and <i>prospect_name</i>, with the understanding that the latter refers to the actual entry field. It's your preference.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="1">If you import an Excel spreadsheet into Google Docs, Google Docs may add an extra, "phantom" worksheet that can block ViziApps' access to the data. If you get an error message about a worksheet that you didn't create and don't see when you connect to the Google Docs spreadsheet, click the All Sheets button at the bottom left of the spreadsheet to see a list of all the worksheets. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="image_background">
            <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/viziapps/apps/HelpGuide/images/All+Sheets+Button.png" style="width: 7in;height: auto;" />
        </p>
        <div class="body_text">
            <p class="ContinueLevel1_Bullet">The phantom worksheet may be listed there. This is an old and rare problem but it may recur. If you plan to import your data by importing an Excel spreadsheet into Google Docs, connect the app to the spreadsheet first, using the Connect to Google Docs button on ViziApps' Data Management page. If the error occurs, you can work around it by copying and pasting the data from the Excel spreadsheet to the Google Docs spreadsheet rather than importing the Excel spreadsheet itself.</p>
