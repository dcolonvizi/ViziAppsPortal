            <h1><a name="kanchor24"></a>Google Apps for Business</h1>
            <p>ViziApps recommends that you do not use the standard Google Drive spreadsheet when developing your app because Google Drive does not support the high request volumes that your app might require. Instead, ViziApps recommends that you use Google Apps for Business which does allow high request volumes, as well as provides high security for access.</p>
            <p>Note that you <i>can</i> use the standard Google Drive spreadsheet for experimentation in developing apps, but there is a bug in Google Drive as of Q2 2012. Users who log into Google Drive may occasionally get a "captcha required" message with no way to enter the captcha. ("captcha" is the acronym for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. They're the tests that ask users to read and type a visually distorted word before getting access to a web page. The theory is that a computer can't read a captcha, thus blocking internet bots.) </p>
            <p>Google Apps for Business is a service from Google that provides a cloud-based collection of business software. It includes Gmail, Google calendar, and various other applications and tools - among them, for the purpose of ViziApps and this discussion, is Google Docs. Data - calendar entries, documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. - is no longer tied to individual PCs but is instead in the cloud. The benefit of using Google Apps for Business is that it offers the same simplicity and ease of use as Google Docs but with more features, power, and security.</p>
            <p>In more detail, what does Google Apps for Business offer?</p>
            <h2>Availability</h2>
            <p>All your data is saved in the cloud automatically. This has several major benefits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="1">The data is always available  to any user, anywhere, on any device with web access that supports the cloud. No need to call the office to have someone find and send you a file.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="2">The data is on the cloud and backed up, reducing the chances of lost data due to a technical problem on a PC.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="3">The cloud model makes collaboration among employees easy. No more need to constantly send the latest copy of a document to all participants as an email attachment. The latest version of the document is in the cloud and accessible to everyone.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>"Subcontracted IT"</h2>
            <p>Adopting Google Apps for Business is equivalent to subcontracting out your IT to a third-party. No need to buy servers, update software, do backups, etc.</p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Google places great emphasis on the security that it uses to safeguard data in the cloud including, as Google says on the Google Apps for Business page at http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/benefits.html:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="1">You own and control your data, not Google.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="2">Your data is constantly backed up.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="3">High security and reliability, with a guaranteed 99.9% uptime. </li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="4">Encryption and authentication of data.</li>
                <li class="BulletLevel1" value="5">Single sign-in to Google Apps simplifies doing business in the cloud . You only need to remember one username and password rather than many.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="body_text">
