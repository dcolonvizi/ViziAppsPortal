			<span class="body" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">The <b>Page Data </b> page
                allows you to&nbsp;set and get data between your device screen on this page and your back end 
            database.
                You can access data in 3 ways. </span></p>
    <p>
        <span class="body" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">In the<strong> 
        Google Docs SpreadSheet</strong> 
        section, you can map the device fields to the columns in your Google Docs 
        WorkSheets, which work just like Excel. Interface commands on this page let you 
        select, insert, update and delete data to and from your phone. A graphical 
        command tool lets you create the commands and choose the device fields and the 
        worksheet fields for the commands. These fields are pre-populated after you 
        enter the credentials to access your Google Docs account.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p>
        <span class="body" style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial">In the<strong>
            Database</strong> section, you can map the device fields to your database 
        tables and fields. To use this you 
        will need to know what a SQL file is, how to generate it and know about SQL statements.</span></p>

        section, you can map the device fields to the parameters of your web service 
        methods. To use this you will need to know what a web service is and how to
