        Go to the <strong>Design</strong> tab and click on the tool for Creating a new 
        app:  <img alt="" src="../../images/new.gif" />. After the new app is created, you can start inserting 
        fields (left of the canvas) onto the canvas and then adding as many pages as you 
        need for your app.</p>
    <p>
        To help you through the process, there are many context help dialogs that will 
        pop up along the way when you click on buttons that look like:  
        <img alt="" src="../../images/help.gif" />. There are also video tutorials placed in context to show you design practices when you click on buttons that look like: <img alt="" src="../../images/play_video.png" style="position:relative;top:5px;"/>  </p>

        Let us know if you have any questions or issues by clicking on the <strong>Support</strong> 
        button.</p>
