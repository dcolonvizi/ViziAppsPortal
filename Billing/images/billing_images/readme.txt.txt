            Summary and Further Reading





    Terms of Use

        These images are public domain (PD), and that means they can be used and edited for whatever purpose you wish, personal or commercial. No attrribution or linking is required. (although a link would be nice...)

    I only make one request:

        I don't want folks to copy the collection to repost online (basically mirroring my site.) I spend a lot of time finding, researching copyright status and editing/retouching as well as donating hundreds of my own images, so I believe that should warrant some consideration. 1

    That said...

        If you wish to include the collection within a GPL-ed Linux distribution or create a package for that distribution, you are more than welcome to do so. I am a big proponent of Open Source and originally created this collection for my kids to use on Linux with AbiWord. (That's why, many years ago, the collection was originally called AbiClipart.)

    Purpose

        First and foremost, the clipart was made as a resource for school kids and others to use without fear of copyright infringement or the risk of running into all sorts of "inappropriate" pictures when searching the web for graphics.

    No user generated content

        Uploading of images by visitors is Not Allowed. There is a risk that uploads of this kind may not be appropriate or may not truly be public domain. (Thus defeating the very purpose of the collection.)

    Regarding possible errors in PD status

        Wpclipart.com respects the intellectual property rights of others, and I ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied and is accessible on the wpclipart.com web site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please send a notice providing the following information:

            The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or the person authorized to act on the owner's behalf;

            A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;

            A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located, such as the URL where it is posted;

            Your name, address, telephone number and email address;

            A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and

            A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf. 



        Send this information to:

        This is in accordance with the The Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
        Any requests which do not adhere to these procedures will be ignored.
        Section 512(c)(3) sets out the elements for notification under the DMCA. Subsection A (17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3)(A)) states that to be effective a notification must include: 1) a physical/electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the infringed right; 2) identification of the copyrighted works claimed to have been infringed; 3) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed; 4) information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party (e.g., the address, telephone number, or email address); 5) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner; and 6) a statement that information in the complaint is accurate and that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner. Subsection B (17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3)(B)) states that if the complaining party does not substantially comply with these requirements the notice will not serve as actual notice for the purpose of Section 512.


    List of sources

         Images at WPClipart are NOT taken from random sources or gleaned from newslists or random posts. Any questions raised about PD status are taken VERY seriously, researched and removed if there is ANY doubt. ALL SOURCES of images (not created by me) are listed below.

          Another use of the links is for those of you who may wish to use the clip art and photos for purposes more broad than just pasting into a document. As mentioned on the frontpage -- the originals were often of much greater resolution. So if you want to play with them in a graphics editor, try the original sources.

        Clipart Sources ------------------------------------------------


        Paul Sherman   email
        Photography (hundreds of plant/flower images, dozens of animal shots), clipart (original and edits -- every single image on site was edited by me with GIMP), as well as mashups/designs (especially prevalent in "page frames" section.)


        OpenClipart.org
        http://www.openclipart.org
        Content converted from SVG and sometimes further edited.
        OpenClipart (OCAL) is THE premier user-submitted clip art site. Over one-fourth of WPClipart content was derived from OCAL. Some sites, (who will remain nameless, since I don't think I am able to name them all in one place...) have no original/edited content but for OCAL images.

        This is a great site, but don't blindly take Public Domain status of all images on faith when dealing with unknown submitters. This warning goes for ANY site that has folks upload their images for them.

        Summary and Further Reading





        All clipart in the collection was obtained exclusively from the sites listed above, or created/photographed personally by me, or gleaned from Wikipedia when properly documented and released into the Public Domain.

        A lot came from OpenClipart. Most maps and flags came from The World Factbook. teachpol.tcnj.edu (Teaching Politics) accounts for many images in the US History Section. A few items each are from Celine's and Watton. A few paintings, so far, are from the WebMuseum (A great site hosted by Ibiblio).

        I also like playing with the photos Jon Sullivan puts into the Public Domain at pdphoto.org. (Although I don't include much due to size.) If you use something from Jon's website, make sure there are not recognizable people in the picture and that the particular photo is marked as Public Domain (most are.)

        Concerning Paintings: The following is quoted from the WikiPedia Public Domain page -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain_image_resources

        Accurate photographs of visual artworks lack expressive content and are automatically in the public domain once the painting's copyright has expired (which it has in the US if it was published before 1923). All other copyright notices can safely be ignored.

        Remember, the two sentences above are about photos of paintings. For more detailed information regarding paintings and Public Domain status see
        the legal case from 1999:
        Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.

        And for a good discussion of paintings, museums and copyrights see:
        Photographs of Public Domain Paintings
        by law professor A Reese.


        Many, many sites claim "free" clipart, but most require accreditation, or a link, or at least that the images NOT be redistributed without permission. NONE of the images from such sites are included here at WPClipart.





        Grumpy Note 1
        I think the practice some folks have of copying a site's content (without any creative input of their own, just to grab ad revenue) is simply rude and greedy. I'm sorry to say that's why I don't update the downloads very often -- other site owners use them to update their sites as well, then down goes my hits.

WPClipart: clipart and photos optimized for use with word processors and inkjet printers. Purpose is to maintain and grow an online collection of artwork for schoolkids and others that is free of copyright concerns as well as safe from inappropriate images. Images were edited for use on wpclipart with the GIMP and some GIMP extras on Absolute Linux. No direct user-uploaded images are allowed.
